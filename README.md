## Features
- Server-side Waystone blocks that allow you to teleport long distances and across dimensions.

### Translating
If you would like to translate this mod into another language, you can do so by creating its respective language file in `src/main/resources/data/sswaystones/lang` and making a PR, all of the keys are in the default `en_us.json` and you can find a tutorial on how translations work on the [Fabric Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:lang). (just make sure you make it in the `data` folder and not `assets`!)
